# Module 02: Control Flow

Programs need to make decisions and repeat tasks. This module covers **Conditionals** (logic) and **Loops** (repetition).

## 📝 Topics Covered

### 1. Conditionals (`conditionals.js`)
- **If / Else**: Basic decision making.
- **Switch**: Handling multiple specific cases.
- **Ternary Operator**: A shortcut for if/else.

### 2. Loops (`loops.js`)
- **For Loop**: Standard counting loop.
- **While Loop**: Repeat while a condition is true.
- **For...Of / For...In**: Modern loops for arrays and objects.

## 🏃 How to Run
```bash
node 02-control-flow/conditionals.js
node 02-control-flow/loops.js
```
