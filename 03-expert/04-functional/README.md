# Module 04: Functional Programming Concepts

Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. In JS, this often involves Closures and Higher-Order Functions.

## 📝 Topics Covered

### 1. Closures (`closures.js`)
- A function that "remembers" its lexical scope even when executed outside that scope.
- Useful for data privacy and factories.

## 🏃 How to Run
```bash
